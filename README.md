# isawake

##### The (eventually) biggest crowdsourced database of when people are awake. Star the project to be updated!

Changing timezones might be painful when you have to contact parents, friends, lovers and collegues.

Example: [http://nicola.isawake.me](http://nicola.isawake.me)
Colors, time and answer will change accordingly to the time.

## Add yourself
Get your `*name*.isawake.me` by adding yourself. At the moment is very geeky, but we will have [user interface](https://github.com/nicolagreco/isawake/issues/9) eventually.

1.  [Create a new file](https://github.com/nicolagreco/isawake/new/master/people) in `people/` calling it yourname.json
2. Add the following information:
```
{
  "offset": -7,
  "range": [8, 24]
}
```

- `offset` is your timezone hours
- `range` is from what time until what time you are awake

3. At the end of the page click on `Commit new file`
